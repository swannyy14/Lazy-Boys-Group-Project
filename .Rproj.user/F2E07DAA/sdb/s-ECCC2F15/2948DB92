It is so heartbreaking, all these kind of tragedies are happening way too often.\n\nReasons why I think #prayfortexas is important.\nThere are several tweets dealing with consolation for shooting in texas occurred in November 5th, 2017. Of course if there is a tradegy such as shootings, people usually tweet on twiiter to comfort people who lost their friends or families in the event of shootings.\n\n\n#GunControlNow\nHere is a SINGLE reason why NOTHING is happening after these mass shootings. It's not the 2nd Amendment, It's Money & Greed.\nWhen drunk driving became an issue, laws were written. Why is gun crime the ONLY thing govt. won't even talk about?! NRA = money.\nFact: Thoughts & prayers have never prevented a mass shooting. Laws have. \nIsn't is strange how mental illness doesn't massacre anyone in Canada, Australia, or the United Kingdom?\n\nReasons why I think #GunControlNow is important.\nWell, as there are several gun shootings happening in the United States recently, such as Las Vegas, Texas, Orlando, Sandy Hooks, people start to arise their voice that there should be gun control immediately. Whenever there is a gun shooting, people just say \"rest in peace. thoughts and prayer.\" However, that's it. No changes for laws related to guns. In other words, people do not care, especially for politicians. After 2~3 days have been passed, people forget those past events and guess what; those shooting events will occur again and another tradegies happen. So, this cycle is rolling and rolling which is very bad.\n\n#NRAisATerroristOrganization\nTerrorism in America: Itâ€™s not a brown people issue.\n13k people killed by guns in USA in 2017 so far\n308 Mass Shootings in USA in 2017 so far\nPeople killed by Islamic Terror Attacks 6,713 WORLDWIDE yes Worldwide!\nStrange how the rules change, based on the shooter. The hypocrisy is ridiculous. \n\nReasons why I think #NRAisATerroristOrganization is important.\nThere are some tweets showing the datas. It demonstrates that people killed by American people in the United States is bigger than people killed by IS worldwide, not USA! This is very shocking fact. It means that there are more domestic acts of terror than international wise. Nevertheless, people in the U.S. do not really do anything if it's shooting. However, if it's terror like IS terror occurred in New York City on November 1st, 2017, then most politicans criticize and decide to make more strict for immigration.",
