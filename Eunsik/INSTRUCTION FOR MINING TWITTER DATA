Now that all of us have the twitter api set up, we have what we need to mine the twitter data.

Run the first few lines of code. That ensures that the working directory is in your assigned folder so as to avoid
potential confusion when we're organizing files.

Basically copy and paste your API Key, API Secret, Access Token, and Access Secret to Corresponding Variables.
Run the code that sets up the twitter api. DO NOT RUN THE WHOLE CODE. 

After that you'll have to run the code that is designated for you. 

Eunsik - you just have to run the top portion. 

Jaewon, Neel - you have two lines to uncomment:
1. uncomment the line with the house index
2. uncomment the line which saves the tweets into the folder

Then run the rest of the assigned code.

It should take some time to run certain parts of the code.

Also, at the end, if you want to make sure that you have indeed saved the data frame as a final product, run
a code something along the lines of:

check_df <- readRDS('THE FILE NAME.rds')
